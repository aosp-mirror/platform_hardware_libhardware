 * This header file defines the interface of the Fused Location Provider.
 * Fused Location Provider is designed to fuse data from various sources
 * like GPS, Wifi, Cell, Sensors, Bluetooth etc to provide a fused location to the
 * upper layers. The advantage of doing fusion in hardware is power savings.
 * The goal is to do this without waking up the AP to get additional data.
 * The software implementation of FLP will decide when to use
 * the hardware fused location. Other location features like geofencing will
 * also be implemented using fusion in hardware.

 * In the diagram above, "a" and "b" are 2 geofences and "c" is the accuracy
 * circle reported by the FLP subsystem. Now with regard to "b", the system is
 * confident that the user is outside. But with regard to "a" is not confident
 * whether it is inside or outside the geofence. If the accuracy remains the
 * same for a sufficient period of time, the UNCERTAIN transition would be
 * triggered with the state set to Unknown. If the accuracy improves later, an
 * appropriate transition should be triggered.  This "sufficient period of time"
 * is defined by the parameter in the add_geofence_area API.
 *     In other words, Unknown state can be interpreted as a state in which the
 * FLP subsystem isn't confident enough that the user is either inside or
 * outside the Geofence. It moves to Unknown state only after the expiry of the
 * timeout.
 *
 * The geofence callback needs to be triggered for the ENTERED and EXITED
 * transitions, when the FLP system is confident that the user has entered
 * (Inside state) or exited (Outside state) the Geofence. An implementation
 * which uses a value of 95% as the confidence is recommended. The callback
 * should be triggered only for the transitions requested by the
 * add_geofence_area call.
 *
 * Even though the diagram and explanation talks about states and transitions,
 * the callee is only interested in the transistions. The states are mentioned
 * here for illustrative purposes.
 *
 * Startup Scenario: When the device boots up, if an application adds geofences,
 * and then we get an accurate FLP location fix, it needs to trigger the
 * appropriate (ENTERED or EXITED) transition for every Geofence it knows about.
 * By default, all the Geofences will be in the Unknown state.
 *
 * When the FLP system is unavailable, flp_geofence_status_callback should be
 * called to inform the upper layers of the same. Similarly, when it becomes
 * available the callback should be called. This is a global state while the
 * UNKNOWN transition described above is per geofence.
